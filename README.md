# Huffmann_Coding (EE224 Course Project)
#### Duration: February'21 to April'21
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable length codes to different char-
acters based on the frequency of occurrence as compared to constant length of conventional ASCII.
We designed an easily extensible digital circuit using a collection of both sequential and combinations logic elements that can perform compression using Huffman coding for a message consisting of 3 letters. Used components like logic-gates, flip-flops, registers, counters, and memory elements working in sync with a system clock.
